Steps on how to create Github Page
-> Step 1: Push the final file to the online repository
-> Go to settings -> pages -> on branch, make sure it is on main and then save
-> The site will be live and the website link will appear
-> At first I was having a hard time understanding github, html and css came easy but designing is not my forte
during this exercise, I believe I improved in my abilities regarding web programming. 
I am excited for the next parts of this course!
